### A hub and catalyst for creativity across CU Denver and CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

The GitHub organization curates programming projects of varied complexity to:

- Showcase unique and interdisciplinary coding projects by CU students.
- Retain a permenant repository to house the many code contributions of Inworks staff over the years.
